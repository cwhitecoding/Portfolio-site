            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Caleb White. I am a software developer in training with aspirations of making a career change into tech. 
                I have experience working in many fields in many locations along the west coast. From California farms to Portland moving companies,
                I have met and explored many opportunities! I enjoy traveling with my long term partner of 10 years and our Goldendoodle kid, Captain!
                My entire life I have enjoyed the outdoors and created a short career around it while farming specialty crops in Sonoma County, CA.
                I enjoyed this work, however I always felt there was something more to life. When I was growing up I have been told multiple
                times by my role models that working hard is good, but to be paid for what I KNOW and not what my body can DO is when I will really 
                see my knowledge and work pay off. This, I believe, is the key to a long life of living happily without an aching body, just a weakth 
                of knowledge. So here I am, succeeding in improving my wealth of knowledge to lead a more happy life of longevity!
